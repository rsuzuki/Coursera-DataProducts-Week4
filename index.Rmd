## Project Information

This presentation is part of the final assignment for the
*Developing Data Science* course available on Coursera. It is part of the Data
Science specialization offered by John Hopkins University.

The goal was to develop a Shiny web application to manipulate some data using
predefined UI components, process them in a remote server and display the 
result.

This particular analysis is based on the *Iris* dataset, readily available on
*datasets* package.

## Shiny Application

The application lets the user predict the species of a flower based on two 
variables:
* Sepal Length
* Petal Length

More specifically, the user can manipulate two sliders - one for each variable - 
and see the prediction in a plot along with the original data.

The prediction model was built using two different algorithms: SVM and Random
Forest. Their outcome should be one of the following species:
* *setosa*
* *versicolor*
* *virginica*

Alternatively, the user can click on the plot to get a prediction.

## Data Visualization

This plot shows the original data, plus a prediction for a flower with sepal 
length of 7 and petal length of 4. Visually, it seems that those two variables 
are enough to predict the outcome with high precision.

```{r, fig.width=11, fig.height=6, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
sample.sepal.length = 7
sample.petal.length = 4

library(e1071)
library(randomForest)
library(RColorBrewer)

# Original data
x   <- iris$Sepal.Length
y   <- iris$Petal.Length
col <- iris$Species
            
# Colors
palette(brewer.pal(5, "Set1"))
            
# Plot the original points
plot(x = x, y = y, col = col, pch = 16, 
    xlab = "Sepal Length", ylab = "Petal Length", 
    xlim = c(4,8), ylim = c(1,7))
legend(7.4, 2.6, legend = unique(col), pch = 16, 
       col = 1:length(col))

# Prediction
formula <- Species ~ Sepal.Length + Petal.Length
svm_model <- svm(formula, data = iris)
prediction <- predict(svm_model, 
                      newdata = data.frame(Sepal.Length = sample.sepal.length, 
                                           Petal.Length = sample.petal.length))
points(sample.sepal.length, sample.petal.length, 
       pch = 13, col = prediction, cex = 4)
```
